 Issues
 -What sets this apart from instgram?
 ->People shoiuld want to use it with out the online features. Like strava has runnning tracking.
 
 I need a reason why people might use this app regardless, and it cant comprimise the original image.
 ->Calorie Image scanning(Innacurate, also not what the app should used for, not meal logging.
 ->recipes? Like maybe but then it turns into too much, maybe abiity to tag or something creative the recipes? make it easy, like attach the recipe at the end, and pictures before.
        -But then issues arise with many mediums of recipe delivery, such as videos or hearing?
        -So for simply text recipes
            -Im thinking use AI, obtain recipe info and reconstruct within our styling, like at the end of a post, allow for human editing, and maybe allow for self recipes or something,
                ------ like activate voice memo, and AI summarizes into a clean recipe...
            -Something so you can look back at your imagew, and go to that very recipe, and other can too,
            -Maybe this is it, the thing that sets this project apart from others. Now executing it.
 -ok like im having ome reservations about this idea, like for example, what the poitn of the recipe thing, majority of people eit,ther cook easy stuff, or the y cook recipes online, its not like they free style, if they do, like yeah maybe?
 
When you finish cooking you want to eat right and have to clean up, so mae sure its easy to post after eating kind of like a draft system, posting should take under 30 seconds even with all this junk, so maybe idk, like the voice memo recipe might take a long time, but i also dont want it to be a hastle, like if the AI knew what recipe to post, or how it was made automatically. Maybe sometimes recipe isnt needed, like when making sandwichesm, or cooking eggs,
        -like maybe a simple mode, and longer post mode
 
 What we need for initial beta version
 -Clean UI
 -Loading times
 -Ai recipe creator featres fully built( this is the strava running tracking)
 - Posts organized
 -Search page organised and implem ented with top chefs, and recipe recs. along with that one note i made about like search filters and implementing them..
 -Tagging friends on post like in insagram
 -Dont remember the rest.
 Simple fixes
 -comment on posts
 -Lot of username issues
 -Change colors maybe (stupid issue, like need a lot more done before working on making it look pretty)
 
 
 -Set goal deadlines once i have some people on board. depending on everything, maybe in time for thanks giving have a beta out
 
 Cook more, savor.
